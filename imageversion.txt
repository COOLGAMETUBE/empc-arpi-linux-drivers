latest release:

IMG-LX017 v3x0
        - OS
                - Now based on "Raspbian Jessie Lite" (2015-11-21)
                - Download https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/ 
                - Non-free packages removed (firmware-atheros, firmware-brcm80211, firmware-libertas, firmware-ralink, firmware-realtek)
                
        - CAN driver
                - updated driver hw_reset timeout value for better soft-reboot CAN detection

older releases:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMG-LX017 v2x5
        - UART driver
                - updated driver to auto detect RS232/RS485 mode jumper

IMG-LX017 v2x4
        - Kernel
                - updated to kernel 3.18.16-v7+
                - changed to device tree model to configure kernel modules

        - CAN driver
                - updated driver initialization


IMG-LX017 v2x3

        - Kernel
                - changed to custom kernel (without device tree), because the standard raspbian 3.18 kernel has microSD card problems

IMG-LX017 v2x2
        - green LED configured as microSD card activity LED

IMG-LX017 v2x1

new features:
        - Kernel
                - changed to device tree model to configure kernel modules
                - installing a modified kernel is no longer required, only the modified kernel drivers
                  for CAN, UART, SPI and RTC are included as kernel modules
        - SPI driver
                - changed from interrupt mode to polling mode (disabled work queue)
        - CAN driver
                - changed to level based interrupts
                - optimized for faster interrupt handling
                - optimized for baudrates up to 500KBit/s. (at 1Mbit/s, CAN frames might
                  get lost because of overruns when using short frame lengths, and/or
                  very small gaps between CAN frames)
                - initial configuation changed to 500KBit/s baudrate in /etc/network/interfaces
        - UART driver
                - changed to level based interrupts
                - interrupt thread changed to higher priority

IMG-LX017 v2x0
        - initial release

IMG-LX017 v1x0
        - development only
